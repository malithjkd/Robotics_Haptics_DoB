# Robotcs_Haptics_DoB_1DOF

## Introduction 

Disterbance observer(DoB) based using to take haptic feedbacks without using external sensors. 
Using corruent controlling force controlling can be achived. Simultaniusly force feedback from the enviroment can be observerd.

## Installation

Basic simulation based on DoB implimented using C.

GNUPLOT is used to plot the simulation results. 

BASH scripts will basicly run the simulation
